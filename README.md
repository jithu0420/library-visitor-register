# library-visitor-register
This is a simple web application to record entry/exit of visitors in a college library.
This project helps to remove manual entry in a register, instead the visitor just has to enter his/her ID number in the textbox provided, and after submitting, the web application will enter the entry/exit time in the database.
After entering the details it will show the name, entry time and exit time of the visitor on the screen.
This project can also be used with a barcode scanner to scan the ID number for faster entry/exit.
